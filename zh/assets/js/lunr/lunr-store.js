        "title": "Phoenix Miner - FAQ [Full Documentation]",
        "excerpt":"we are actively working on bringing many new features in the future releases.    FAQ      Q001: Why another miner?   A: We feel that the competition is good for the end user. In the first releases of PhoenixMiner we focused on the basic features and on the mining speed but we are now working on making our miner easier to use and even faster.   Q002: Can I run several instances of PhoenixMiner on the same rig?   A: Yes, but make sure that each GPU is used by a single miner (use the -gpus, -amd, or -nvidia command-line options to limit the GPUs that given instance of PhoenixMiner actually uses).   Another possible problem is that all instances will use the default CDM remote port 3333, which will prevent proper remote control for all but the first instance. To fix this problem, use the -cdmport command-line option to change the CDM remote port form its default value.      Q003: Can I run PhoenixMiner simultaneously on the same rig with other miners?   A: Yes, but see the answer to the previous question for how to avoid problems.   Q004: What is a stale share?   A: The ethash coins usually have very small average block time (15 seconds in most instances). On the other hand, to achieve high mining speed we must keep the GPUs busy so we can’t switch the current job too often. If our rigs finds a share just after the someone else has found a solution for the current block, our share is a stale share. Ideally, the stale shares should be minimal as same pools do not give any reward for stale shares, and even these that do reward stall shares, give only partial reward for these shares. If the share is submitted too long after the block has ended, the pool may even fully reject it.   Q005: Why is the percentage of stale shares reported by PhoenixMiner smaller than the one shown by the pool?   A: PhonixMiner can only detect the stale shares that were discovered after it has received a new job (i.e. the “very stale”) shares. There is additional latency in the pool itself, and in the network connection, which makes a share stall even if it was technically found before the end of the block from the miner’s point of view. As pools only reports the shares as accepted or rejected, there is no way for the miner to determine the stale shares from the pool’s point of view.   Q006: What is the meaning of the “actual share difficulty” shown by PhoenixMiner when a share is found?   A: It allows you to see how close you were to finding an actual block (a rare event these days for the most miners with reasonable-sized mining rigs). You can find the current difficulty for given coin on sites like whattomine.com and then check to see if you have exceeded it with your maximum share difficulty. If you did, you have found a block (which is what the mining is all about).   Q007: What is the meaning of “effective speed” shown by PhoenixMiner’s statistics?   A: This is a measure of the actually found shares, which determines how the pool sees your miner hashrate. This number should be close to the average hashrate of your rig (usually a 2-4% lower than it) depending you your current luck in finding shares. This statistic is meaningless in the first few hours after the miner is started and will level off to the real value with time.   Q008: Why is the effective hashrate shown by the pool lower than the one shown by PhoenixMiner?   A: There are two reasons for this: stale shares and luck. The stale shares are rewarded at only about 50-70% by most pools. The luck factor should level itself off over time but it may take a few days before it does. If your effective hashrate reported by the pool is consistently lower than the hashrate of your rig by more than 5-7% than you should look at the number of stale shares and the average share acceptance time - if it is higher than 100 ms, try to find a pool that is near to you geographically to lower the network latency. You can also restart your rig, or try another pool.   ","categories": ["documentation"],

The last one controls the memory refresh rate, and the first three are other timings. The possible values for each of them are from 0 to 100, where 0 are the default timings, and 100 is the most aggressive timing (most GPUs probably wont work with 100). \tThe -straps option gives an easy way to set one of the predefined levels of VRAM timing adjustment. The possible values are 0 to 6. 0 is the default value and uses the default timings from the VBIOS. Each strap level corresponds to a predefined set of memory timings (\"-vmt1\", \"-vmt2\", \"-vmt3\", \"-vmr\"). Strap level 3 is the fastest predefined level and may not work on most cards, 1 is the slowest (but still faster than the default timings). Strap levels 4 to 6 are the same as 1 to 3 but with less aggressive refresh rates (i.e. lower \"-vmr\" values). \tWhen using the VRAM timing options, start with lower values and make sure that the cards are stable before trying higher and more aggressive settings. You can use -straps along with the other options. For example -straps 1 -vmt1 60 will use the timings from 1st strap level but -vmt1 will be set to 60 instead of whatever value is specified by the 1st strap level. In such case the -straps option must be specified first. \tThe VRAM timing options can be quite different between the GPUs, even when the GPUs are the same model. Therefore, you can (and probably should) specify the VRAM timing options separately for each GPU. Please let us know if you have any problems or questions related to PhoenixMiner 5.1b.

Changelog   The changes in this release (since 5.2c) include the following:      Added support for -daglim for AMD Fiji, Tonga, and Baffin cards with 4GB VRAM, so you will be able to use them some time beyond epoch 373 (Windows), or 381 (Linux)   New kernels for 4GB AMD cards with higher hashrate when -daglim is in effect   Added -daglim and -rxboost support in Linux. The default -daglim value in Linux is 4064 for older drivers (before 19.50), and 4076 for the newer drivers   Added support for the AMD Linux drivers 20.20, and 20.30   Added support for the latest AMD Linux drivers 20.40-1147286 (however they seem to have hardware control problems with some cards, so no need to upgrade for now)   The changes of the previous beta (5.2c) since the last version (5.1c) are:      The kernels are modified to allow bigger DAG limit of 4023 MB under Windows.

Use the -straps command-line option to activate it (example: -straps 1 will activate the lowest strap level)   The Nvidia memory timing (straps) option is improved and now is turned off during DAG generation to avoid any possible instability issues   Many other small improvements and fixes   Additional notes   Here are some additional notes:      The -daglim option works on Polaris (RX470, RX480, RX570, RX580, RX590), Baffin (RX560, RX550), Tonga, and Fiji cards. It limits the DAG size to &lt;n&gt; MB to allow mining on 4 GB cards a few weeks after epoch 374 on Windows (or after 381 on Linux). The possible values are the exact DAG limit in MB, or 0 (turn off the DAG limit), or 1 (automatic DAG limit size, usually around 4023 MB under Windows; this is the default option). Note that the hashrate will drop significantly with each epoch after the DAG limit is in effect. If the hashrate drops too much (e.g. from 28 MH/s to just 2-3 MH/s, you need to use lower value, for example -daglim 3990   (Windows) With PhoenixMiner 5.2d either remove the -daglim option entirely (it is set to auto by default), or set it to -daglim 4023, which should work on all 470/480/570/580/590 cards with “good” drivers (see bellow)   (Windows) If you cards doesn’t work with the default DAG limit of 4023 and require substantial decrease to 4006 or 3990, you need to update to one of the “good” AMD drivers for Windows: from 18.12.1.1 to 19.7.5 (inclusive), and from 19.12.2 to 20.11.1 (inclusive)   (Linux) With PhoenixMiner 5.2d either remove the -daglim option entirely (it is set to auto by default), or set it to -daglim 4064 on older drivers (before 19.50), or -daglim 4076 on newer drivers.   (Linux) When the -daglim option is in effect (i.e. if you are mining ETH or ETC with 4GB cards), the miner will restart on each new DAG epoch, and will force serial (one-by-one) generation of the DAG buffers. To allow more stable operation under these conditions, it is best to use -rmode 0 and to use a script to restart the miner when it exits. Two such scripts are provided with the miner: start_amd_4g_old_drv.sh for older drivers (before 19.50, note that when using -rmode 0, the -daglim for these older drivers can be increased to 4068), and start_amd_4g_new_drv.sh for newer drivers. Make sure to change the pools and the wallet in these scripts with your own before using them for mining.   It is also important to use auto-tune (do not specify -gt values in the command line) because the optimal -gt value may change with each new epoch, and will definitely be different than before.   Using -rxboost, -vmr, or -straps on AMD cards requires running as administrator (or as root under Linux), so you need to run PhoenixMiner as administrator for the VRAM timing options to work. Note that the -mt option will still work without running as administrator.   The -rxboost option is only supported on GDDR5 cards (RX4xx/RX5xx or older).   The VRAM timing options can be quite different between the GPUs, even when the GPUs are the same model. Therefore, you can (and probably should) specify the VRAM timing options separately for each GPU.   ","categories": ["download"],

Changelog   The new features in this release are:   Added support for the new ETCHash algorithm that will be used by the ETC blockchain from Nov 28, 2020. If you want to mine ETC, you should add -coin etc to your command-line, or, COIN: etc to your epools.txt file. See the start_miner_etc.bat and epools_example.txt files for examples     Here is a full command-line example for mining ETC (IMPORTANT: replace the ETC address with your own ETC wallet address in the -wal option, Rig001 is the name of the rig):    Example:   PhoenixMiner.exe -pool ssl://eu1-etc.ethermine.org:5555 -wal 0x6481c50D9df43314e660716F6dB58f04de71ae0e.Rig001 -coin etc     Here are a couple of epools.txt lines for ETC mining:    Example:   POOL: ssl://eu1-etc.ethermine.org:5555, WAL: 0x6481c50D9df43314e660716F6dB58f04de71ae0e.Rig001, COIN: etc  POOL: etc-eu1.nanopool.org:19999, WAL: 0x6481c50D9df43314e660716F6dB58f04de71ae0e.Rig001, COIN: etc     If you do not intend to mine Ethereum Classic (ETC) you can stay on PhoenixMiner 5.2e for now because there are no other significant changes besides the support for ETCHash.

Changelog      New kernels for AMD Vega and Navi GPUs that are slightly faster when the DAG buffer is approaching or passing 4GB in size (the current ETH DAG is close to 4GB). To use these new kernels, you need to use drivers 20.5.1 or later under Win10, or 20.10.x or later under Linux   Automatic re-running auto-tune as needed when switching to a different DAG buffer type (e.g. when switching from ETH to ETC, or back)   Added support for the latest AMD Windows 10 drivers 20.12.1 and 20.11.3   Fixed crash when trying to set -mvddc on very old AMD drivers (including the beta blockchain drivers from 2017)   Other small fixes and improvements   Some notes on the best (or at least some of the better) drivers for AMD cards:   If you have 6GB or 8GB card that is at least Polaris (i.e. 470/480/570/580, Vega, Radeon VII, Navi), you should run at least driver 20.5.1 under Windows 10, or driver 20.10.x under Linux.   If you have 4GB Polaris card (i.e. 470/480/570/580), ideally you should also run drivers 20.5.1 or later. At the very least the drivers should be either 18.12.1.1 to 19.7.5 (inclusive), or 19.12.2 and later. Under Linux, drivers 19.x.x or 20.x.x should be OK for 4GB cards.   Avoid using the 20.40.x, and 20.45.x drivers under Linux.
