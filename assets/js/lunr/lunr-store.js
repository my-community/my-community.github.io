        "excerpt":"we are actively working on bringing many new features in the future releases.    Introduction   Make sure to replace the pool and wallet address by what you’re using in all files.   PhoenixMiner is fast (arguably the fastest) Ethash (ETH, ETC, etc.) miner that supports both AMD and Nvidia cards (including in mixed mining rigs).   It runs under Windows x64 and Linux x64 and has a developer fee of 0.65% (the lowest in the industry). This means that every 90 minutes the miner will mine for us, its developers, for 35 seconds.   PhoenixMiner also supports Ubqhash for mining UBQ, ProgPOW for mining BCI, and dual mining Ethash/Ubqhash with Blake2s.   The hashrate is generally higher than Claymore’s Ethereum miner (we have measured about 0.4-1.3% hashrate improvement but your results may be slightly lower or higher depending on the GPUs, drivers, and other variables).   To achieve highest possible hashrate on AMD cards you may need to manually adjust the GPU tune factor (a number from 8 to about 400, which can be changed interactively with the + and - keys while the miner is running).   If you have used Claymore’s Dual Ethereum miner, you can switch to PhoenixMiner with minimal hassle as we support most of Claymore’s command-line options and configuration files.   Please note that PhoenixMiner is extensively tested on many mining rigs but there still may be some bugs.   Additionally, we are actively working on bringing many new features in the future releases. If you encounter any problems or have feature requests, please post them in our thread on the bitcointalk.org forum.   ","categories": ["documentation"],

        "excerpt":"we are actively working on bringing many new features in the future releases.    FAQ      Q001: Why another miner?   A: We feel that the competition is good for the end user. In the first releases of PhoenixMiner we focused on the basic features and on the mining speed but we are now working on making our miner easier to use and even faster.   Q002: Can I run several instances of PhoenixMiner on the same rig?   A: Yes, but make sure that each GPU is used by a single miner (use the -gpus, -amd, or -nvidia command-line options to limit the GPUs that given instance of PhoenixMiner actually uses).   Another possible problem is that all instances will use the default CDM remote port 3333, which will prevent proper remote control for all but the first instance. To fix this problem, use the -cdmport command-line option to change the CDM remote port form its default value.      Q003: Can I run PhoenixMiner simultaneously on the same rig with other miners?   A: Yes, but see the answer to the previous question for how to avoid problems.   Q004: What is a stale share?   A: The ethash coins usually have very small average block time (15 seconds in most instances). On the other hand, to achieve high mining speed we must keep the GPUs busy so we can’t switch the current job too often. If our rigs finds a share just after the someone else has found a solution for the current block, our share is a stale share. Ideally, the stale shares should be minimal as same pools do not give any reward for stale shares, and even these that do reward stall shares, give only partial reward for these shares. If the share is submitted too long after the block has ended, the pool may even fully reject it.   Q005: Why is the percentage of stale shares reported by PhoenixMiner smaller than the one shown by the pool?   A: PhonixMiner can only detect the stale shares that were discovered after it has received a new job (i.e. the “very stale”) shares. There is additional latency in the pool itself, and in the network connection, which makes a share stall even if it was technically found before the end of the block from the miner’s point of view. As pools only reports the shares as accepted or rejected, there is no way for the miner to determine the stale shares from the pool’s point of view.   Q006: What is the meaning of the “actual share difficulty” shown by PhoenixMiner when a share is found?   A: It allows you to see how close you were to finding an actual block (a rare event these days for the most miners with reasonable-sized mining rigs). You can find the current difficulty for given coin on sites like whattomine.com and then check to see if you have exceeded it with your maximum share difficulty. If you did, you have found a block (which is what the mining is all about).   Q007: What is the meaning of “effective speed” shown by PhoenixMiner’s statistics?   A: This is a measure of the actually found shares, which determines how the pool sees your miner hashrate. This number should be close to the average hashrate of your rig (usually a 2-4% lower than it) depending you your current luck in finding shares. This statistic is meaningless in the first few hours after the miner is started and will level off to the real value with time.   Q008: Why is the effective hashrate shown by the pool lower than the one shown by PhoenixMiner?   A: There are two reasons for this: stale shares and luck. The stale shares are rewarded at only about 50-70% by most pools. The luck factor should level itself off over time but it may take a few days before it does. If your effective hashrate reported by the pool is consistently lower than the hashrate of your rig by more than 5-7% than you should look at the number of stale shares and the average share acceptance time - if it is higher than 100 ms, try to find a pool that is near to you geographically to lower the network latency. You can also restart your rig, or try another pool.   ","categories": ["documentation"],

The last one controls the memory refresh rate, and the first three are other timings. The possible values for each of them are from 0 to 100, where 0 are the default timings, and 100 is the most aggressive timing (most GPUs probably wont work with 100). \tThe -straps option gives an easy way to set one of the predefined levels of VRAM timing adjustment. The possible values are 0 to 6. 0 is the default value and uses the default timings from the VBIOS. Each strap level corresponds to a predefined set of memory timings (\"-vmt1\", \"-vmt2\", \"-vmt3\", \"-vmr\"). Strap level 3 is the fastest predefined level and may not work on most cards, 1 is the slowest (but still faster than the default timings). Strap levels 4 to 6 are the same as 1 to 3 but with less aggressive refresh rates (i.e. lower \"-vmr\" values). \tWhen using the VRAM timing options, start with lower values and make sure that the cards are stable before trying higher and more aggressive settings. You can use -straps along with the other options. For example -straps 1 -vmt1 60 will use the timings from 1st strap level but -vmt1 will be set to 60 instead of whatever value is specified by the 1st strap level. In such case the -straps option must be specified first. \tThe VRAM timing options can be quite different between the GPUs, even when the GPUs are the same model. Therefore, you can (and probably should) specify the VRAM timing options separately for each GPU. Please let us know if you have any problems or questions related to PhoenixMiner 5.1b.

Changelog   The changes in this release (since 5.2c) include the following:      Added support for -daglim for AMD Fiji, Tonga, and Baffin cards with 4GB VRAM, so you will be able to use them some time beyond epoch 373 (Windows), or 381 (Linux)   New kernels for 4GB AMD cards with higher hashrate when -daglim is in effect   Added -daglim and -rxboost support in Linux. The default -daglim value in Linux is 4064 for older drivers (before 19.50), and 4076 for the newer drivers   Added support for the AMD Linux drivers 20.20, and 20.30   Added support for the latest AMD Linux drivers 20.40-1147286 (however they seem to have hardware control problems with some cards, so no need to upgrade for now)   The changes of the previous beta (5.2c) since the last version (5.1c) are:      The kernels are modified to allow bigger DAG limit of 4023 MB under Windows.

Use the -straps command-line option to activate it (example: -straps 1 will activate the lowest strap level)   The Nvidia memory timing (straps) option is improved and now is turned off during DAG generation to avoid any possible instability issues   Many other small improvements and fixes   Additional notes   Here are some additional notes:      The -daglim option works on Polaris (RX470, RX480, RX570, RX580, RX590), Baffin (RX560, RX550), Tonga, and Fiji cards. It limits the DAG size to &lt;n&gt; MB to allow mining on 4 GB cards a few weeks after epoch 374 on Windows (or after 381 on Linux). The possible values are the exact DAG limit in MB, or 0 (turn off the DAG limit), or 1 (automatic DAG limit size, usually around 4023 MB under Windows; this is the default option). Note that the hashrate will drop significantly with each epoch after the DAG limit is in effect. If the hashrate drops too much (e.g. from 28 MH/s to just 2-3 MH/s, you need to use lower value, for example -daglim 3990   (Windows) With PhoenixMiner 5.2d either remove the -daglim option entirely (it is set to auto by default), or set it to -daglim 4023, which should work on all 470/480/570/580/590 cards with “good” drivers (see bellow)   (Windows) If you cards doesn’t work with the default DAG limit of 4023 and require substantial decrease to 4006 or 3990, you need to update to one of the “good” AMD drivers for Windows: from 18.12.1.1 to 19.7.5 (inclusive), and from 19.12.2 to 20.11.1 (inclusive)   (Linux) With PhoenixMiner 5.2d either remove the -daglim option entirely (it is set to auto by default), or set it to -daglim 4064 on older drivers (before 19.50), or -daglim 4076 on newer drivers.   (Linux) When the -daglim option is in effect (i.e. if you are mining ETH or ETC with 4GB cards), the miner will restart on each new DAG epoch, and will force serial (one-by-one) generation of the DAG buffers. To allow more stable operation under these conditions, it is best to use -rmode 0 and to use a script to restart the miner when it exits. Two such scripts are provided with the miner: start_amd_4g_old_drv.sh for older drivers (before 19.50, note that when using -rmode 0, the -daglim for these older drivers can be increased to 4068), and start_amd_4g_new_drv.sh for newer drivers. Make sure to change the pools and the wallet in these scripts with your own before using them for mining.   It is also important to use auto-tune (do not specify -gt values in the command line) because the optimal -gt value may change with each new epoch, and will definitely be different than before.   Using -rxboost, -vmr, or -straps on AMD cards requires running as administrator (or as root under Linux), so you need to run PhoenixMiner as administrator for the VRAM timing options to work. Note that the -mt option will still work without running as administrator.   The -rxboost option is only supported on GDDR5 cards (RX4xx/RX5xx or older).   The VRAM timing options can be quite different between the GPUs, even when the GPUs are the same model. Therefore, you can (and probably should) specify the VRAM timing options separately for each GPU.   ","categories": ["download"],

Changelog      New kernels for AMD Vega and Navi GPUs that are slightly faster when the DAG buffer is approaching or passing 4GB in size (the current ETH DAG is close to 4GB). To use these new kernels, you need to use drivers 20.5.1 or later under Win10, or 20.10.x or later under Linux   Automatic re-running auto-tune as needed when switching to a different DAG buffer type (e.g. when switching from ETH to ETC, or back)   Added support for the latest AMD Windows 10 drivers 20.12.1 and 20.11.3   Fixed crash when trying to set -mvddc on very old AMD drivers (including the beta blockchain drivers from 2017)   Other small fixes and improvements   Some notes on the best (or at least some of the better) drivers for AMD cards:   If you have 6GB or 8GB card that is at least Polaris (i.e. 470/480/570/580, Vega, Radeon VII, Navi), you should run at least driver 20.5.1 under Windows 10, or driver 20.10.x under Linux.   If you have 4GB Polaris card (i.e. 470/480/570/580), ideally you should also run drivers 20.5.1 or later. At the very least the drivers should be either 18.12.1.1 to 19.7.5 (inclusive), or 19.12.2 and later. Under Linux, drivers 19.x.x or 20.x.x should be OK for 4GB cards.

Changelog      Added support for DAG epochs up to 500   Fixed crash (or GPUs not detected error) when using the latest Windows Nvidia drivers 460.79 and 460.89   Validated support for Nvidia RTX 3090, 3080, 3070, and 3060Ti GPUs. Those still use the current kernels and there are no speed increases from the previous PhoenixMiner release   Add support for the older AMD Linux driver 19.50-1011208-ubuntu-18.04 (used by some Linux mining OSes and other software)   Added new kernels to allow mining on AMD Hawaii cards (R9 390, etc.) with the current and future DAG epochs (even with DAG buffer above 4GB for the 8GB cards).   Note that the AMD Windows drivers do not support compute mode for Hawaii cards, so the hashrate will be quite low (14-15 MH/s with the current ETH DAG epoch). This problem is fixed under Linux, where you can get the full 29-30 MH/s speed out of the Hawaii cards.

Inside the archive you will find a file README.txt with installation instructions.   Make sure to replace the pool and wallet address by what you’re using in all files.   Changelog   The changes in this release (since 5.5b) include the following:      Added support for the latest AMD Windows driver 21.1.1 (still, we don’t recommend using the 21.1.1 driver yet - we had some instability issues with it even when just idling on the desktop!)   Added new -mcdag parameter to reset the memory overclock on Nvidia cards during DAG generation. This may allow you to set higher memory overclock on your Nvidia cards without risking corrupt DAG buffer, which can lead to excessive number of incorrect shares. Use -mcdag 1 (by default the value is 0, which means turned off) to use this new feature.   Under Linux -mcdag 1 will execute a shell script named daggen.sh (if present in the current directory) for each Nvidia GPU, passing the GPU index as the first argument, and PCIE bus ID as second argument. The miner will then wait for about 7 seconds before starting DAG generation to allow the script enough time to reset the memory overclock.   The -tt parameter is now strictly for controlling the fan behavior. E.g. -tt 60 sets auto-fan speed with target temperature 60C; -tt -70 sets fixed fan speed 70%; and -tt 0 turns off the fan control. All these can be specified per GPU.   There is a new -hwm parameter that allows controlling the frequency of the hardware monitoring, which was also done by -tt in the previous versions of PhoenixMiner   Other small improvements and fixes   The changes of the previous beta (5.5b) since the last version (5.4c) are:   Added native kernels for AMD RX6800 and RX6900 GPUs. These are faster than the generic kernels and produce a lot less stale shares Updated kernels for AMD Polaris, Vega and Navi GPUs that are slightly faster and use less power than before when mining ETH.

Currently the following options can be changed without restarting: -mi, -gt, -sci, -clf, -nvf, -gpow, and most of the hardware control parameters (-tt, -fcm, -fanmin, -fanmax, -powlim, -tmax, -ttli, -cclock, -cvddc, -mclock, -mvddc, -ppf, -straps, -vmt1, -vmt2, -vmt3, -vmr).    Mining options   -amdUse only AMD cards  -acmTurn on AMD compute mode on the supported GPUs. This is equivalent of pressing y in the miner console.  -nvidiaUse only Nvidia cards  -gpus &lt;123 ..n&gt;Use only the specified GPUs (if more than 10, separate the indexes with comma)  -mi &lt;n&gt;Set the mining intensity (0 to 14; 12 is the default for new kernels). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -gt &lt;n&gt;Set the GPU tuning parameter (6 to 400). The default is 15. You can change the tuning parameter interactively with the + and - keys in the miner’s console window. You may specify this option per-GPU. If you don’t specify -gt or you specify value 0, the miner will use auto-tuning to determine the best GT value. Note that when the GPU is dual-mining, it ignores the -gt values, and uses -sci instead.  -sci &lt;n&gt;Set the dual mining intensity (1 to 1000). The default is 30. As you increase the value of -sci, the secondary coin hashrate will increase but the price will be higher power consumption and/or lower ethash hashrate. You can change the this parameter interactively with the + and - keys in the miner’s console window. You may specify this option per-GPU. If you set -sci to 0, the miner will use auto-tuning to determine the best value, while trying to maximize the ethash hashrate regardless of the secondary coin hashrate.  -clKernel &lt;n&gt;Type of OpenCL kernel: 0 - generic, 1 - optimized, 2 - alternative, 3 - turbo (1 is the default) You may specify this option per-GPU.  -clgreen &lt;n&gt;Use the power-efficient (“green”) kernels (0: no, 1: yes; default: 0). You may specify this option per-GPU. Note that you have to run auto-tune again as the optimal GT values are completely different for the green kernels  -clNew &lt;n&gt;Use new AMD kernels if supported (0: no, 1: yes; default: 1). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -clf &lt;n&gt;AMD kernel sync (0: never, 1: periodic; 2: always; default: 1). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -nvKernel &lt;n&gt;Type of Nvidia kernel: 0 auto (default), 1 old (v1), 2 newer (v2), 3 latest (v3). Note that v3 kernels are only supported on GTX10x0 GPUs. Also note that dual mining is supported only by v2 kernels. You may specify this option per-GPU.  -nvdo &lt;n&gt;Enable Nvidia driver-specific optimizations (0 - no, the default; 1 - yes). Try -nvdo 1 if your are unstable. You may specify this option per-GPU.  -nvNew &lt;n&gt;Use new Nvidia kernels if supported (0: no, 1: yes; default: 1). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -nvf &lt;n&gt;Nvidia kernel sync (0: never, 1: periodic; 2: always; 3: forced; default: 1). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -mode &lt;n&gt;Mining mode (0: dual mining if dual pool(s) are specified; 1: ethash only even if dual pools are specified). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -gbase &lt;n&gt;Set the index of the first GPU (0 or 1, default: 1)  -minRigSpeed &lt;n&gt;Restart the miner if avg 5 min speed is below &lt;n&gt; MH/s  -eres &lt;n&gt;Allocate DAG buffers big enough for n epochs ahead (default: 2) to avoid allocating new buffers on each DAG epoch switch, which should improve DAG switch stability. You may specify this option per-GPU.  -daglim &lt;n&gt;(AMD Polaris, Baffin, Tonga, or Fiji cards only) Limit the DAG size to &lt;n&gt; MB to allow mining on 4 GB cards a few weeks after epoch 373 on Windows (or 381 on Linux). The possible values except the exact DAG limit are also 0 (turn off the DAG limit), 1 (automatic DAG limit size, usually 4023 MB under Windows; this is the default). Note that the hashrate will drop significantly with each epoch after the DAG limit is in effect. If the hashrate drops too much (e.g. from 28 MH/s to just 2-3 MH/s, you need to use lower value, for example -daglim 3996 or even lower.  -dagrestart &lt;n&gt;Restart the miner when allocating buffer for a new DAG epoch. The possible values are: 0 - never, 1 - always, 2 - auto (the miner decides depending on the driver version). This is relevant for 4 GB AMD cards, which may have problems with new DAG epochs after epoch 350.  -lidag &lt;n&gt;Slow down DAG generation to avoid crashes when switching DAG epochs (0-3, default: 0 - fastest, 3 - slowest). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -gser &lt;n&gt;Serializing DAG creation on multiple GPUs (0 - no serializing, all GPUs generate the DAG simultaneously, this is the default; 1 - partial overlap of DAG generation on each GPU; 2 - no overlap (each GPU waits until the previous one has finished generating the DAG); 3-10 - from 1 to 8 seconds delay after each GPU DAG generation before the next one)  -gpureset &lt;n&gt;Fully reset GPU when paused (0 - no, 1 - yes; default: no, except on 1080Ti). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -rvram &lt;n&gt;Minimum free VRAM in MB (-1: don’t check; default: 384 for Windows, and 128 for Linux)  -altinitUse alternative way to initialize AMD cards to prevent startup crashes  -wdog &lt;n&gt;Enable watchdog timer: 1 - yes, 0 - no (1 is the default). The watchdog timer checks periodically if any of the GPUs freezes and if it does, restarts the miner (see the -rmode command-line parameter for the restart modes)  -wdtimeout &lt;n&gt;Watchdog timeout (30 - 300; default 45 seconds). You can use this parameter to increase the default watchdog timeout in case it restarts the miner needlessly  -rmode &lt;n&gt;Selects the restart mode when a GPU crashes or freezes: :0: disabled - miner will shut down instead of restarting :1: restart with the same command line options - this is the default :2: reboot (shut down miner and execute reboot.bat)  -log &lt;n&gt;Selects the log file mode: :0: disabled - no log file will be written :1: write log file but don’t show debug messages on screen (default) :2: write log file and show debug messages on screen  -logfile &lt;name&gt;Set the name of the logfile. If you place an asterisk (*) in the logfile name, it will be replaced by the current date/time to create a unique name every time PhoenixMiner is started. If there is no asterisk in the logfile name, the new log entries will be added to end of the same file. If you want to use the same logfile but the contents to be overwritten every time when you start the miner, put a dollar sign ($) character in the logfile name (e.g. -logfile my_log.txt$).  -logdir &lt;path&gt;Set a path where the logfile(s) will be created  -logsmaxsize &lt;n&gt;Maximum size of the logfiles in MB. The default is 200 MB (use 0 to turn off the limitation). On startup, if the logfiles are larger than the specified limit, the oldest are deleted. If you use a single logfile (by using -logfile), then it is truncated if it is bigger than the limit and a new one is created.  -config &lt;name&gt;Load a file with configuration options that will be added to the command-line options. Note that the order is important. For example, if we have a config.txt file that contains -cclock 1000 and we specify command line -cclock 1100 -config config.txt, the options from the config.txt file will take precedence and the resulting -cclock will be 1000. If the order is reversed (-config config.txt -cclock 1100) then the second option takes precedence and the resulting -cclock will be 1100. Note that only one -config option is allowed. Also note that if you reload the config file with c key or with the remote interface, its options will take precedence over whatever you have specified in the command-line.  -timeout &lt;n&gt;Restart miner according to -rmode after n minutes  -pauseat &lt;hh:mm&gt;Pause the miner at hh:mm (24 hours time). You can specify multiple times: -pauseat 6:00,12:00  -resumeat &lt;hh:mm&gt;Resume the miner at hh::mm (24 hours time). You can specify multiple times: -resumeat 8:00,22:00  -gswin &lt;n&gt;GPU stats time window (5-30 sec; default: 15; use 0 to revert to pre-2.8 way of showing momentary stats)  -gsi &lt;n&gt;Speed stats interval (5-30 sec; default: 5; use 0 to disable). The detailed stats are still shown every 45 seconds and aren’t affected by the -gsi value  -astats &lt;n&gt;Show advanced stats from Web sources (0: no; 1: yes). By default the coin exchange rates are updated every 4 hours, and the coin difficulty is updated every 8 hours. You can increase these periods by specifying for example -astats 12, which will increase update periods to 12 and 24 hours respectively  -gpow &lt;n&gt;Lower the GPU usage to n% of maximum (default: 100). If you already use -mi 0 (or other low value) use -li instead. You may specify this option per-GPU.  -li &lt;n&gt;Another way to lower the GPU usage. Bigger n values mean less GPU utilization; the default is 0. You may specify this option per-GPU.  -resetocReset the HW overclocking settings on startup  -leaveocDo not reset overclocking settings when closing the miner    Hardware control options (you may specify these options per-GPU)    -hwm &lt;n&gt;Frequency of hardware monitoring (one setting for all cards, the default is 1): 0 - no HW monitoring or control, 1 - normal monitoring, 2 to 5 - less frequent monitoring.  -tt &lt;n&gt;Set fan control target temperature (special values: 0 - no fan control, negative - fixed fan speed at n %)  -hstats &lt;n&gt;Level of hardware monitoring: 0 - temperature and fan speed only; 1 - temperature, fan speed, and power; 2 - full (include core/memory clocks, voltages, P-states). The default is 1.  -pidle &lt;n&gt;Idle power consumption of the rig in W. Will be added to the GPU power consumption when calculating the total power consumption of the rig.  -ppf &lt;n&gt;The power usage of each GPU will be multiplied by this value to get the actual usage. This value is in percent, so for example if the GPU reports 100 W power usage and you have specified -ppf 106 the GPU power usage will be calculated to be 100 * (106 / 100) = 106 W. This allows you to correct for the efficiency of the PSUs and the individual GPUs. You can also specify this value for each GPU separately.  -prate &lt;n&gt;Price of the electricity in USD per kWh (e.g. -prate 0.1). If specified the miner will calculate the rig daily electricity cost  -fanmin &lt;n&gt;Set fan control min speed in % (-1 for default)  -fanmax &lt;n&gt;Set fan control max speed in % (-1 for default)  -fcm &lt;n&gt;Set fan control mode (0 - auto, 1 - use VBIOS fan control, 2 - forced fan control; default: 0)  -fanidle &lt;n&gt;(Linux only) Set idle fan speed in % (-1 is auto, the default is 20)  -fpwm &lt;n&gt;(Linux only) Fan PWM mode (0 - auto, 1 - direct, 2 - Polaris, 3 - Vega, 4 - Radeon VII, Navi; default: 0)  -tmax &lt;n&gt;Set fan control max temperature (0 for default). If this feature is not supported by the driver, -ttli is set to the same temperature instead  -powlim &lt;n&gt;Set GPU power limit in % (from -75 to 75, 0 for default)  -cclock &lt;n&gt;Set GPU core clock in MHz (0 for default). For Nvidia cards use relative values (e.g. -300 or +400)  -cvddc &lt;n&gt;Set GPU core voltage in mV (0 for default)  -mclock &lt;n&gt;Set GPU memory clock in MHz (0 for default). For Nvidia cards use relative values (e.g. -300 or +400)  -mvddc &lt;n&gt;Set GPU memory voltage in mV (0 for default)  -tstop &lt;n&gt;Pause a GPU when temp is &gt;= n deg C (0 for default; i.e. off)  -tstart &lt;n&gt;Resume a GPU when temp is &lt;= n deg C (0 for default; i.e. off)  -mt &lt;n&gt;VRAM timings (AMD under Windows only): 0 - default VBIOS values; 1 - faster timings; 2 - fastest timings. The default is 0. This is useful for mining with AMD cards without modding the VBIOS.  -leavemtDo not reset memory timing level (-mt) to 0 when closing  -ttli &lt;n&gt;Lower GPU usage when GPU temperature is above n deg C. The default value is 0, which means do not lower the usage regardless of the GPU temperature. This option is useful whenever -tmax is not working. If you are using both -tt and -ttli options, the temperature in -tt should be lower than the -ttli to avoid throttling the GPUs without using the fans to properly cool them first.  -straps &lt;n&gt;Memory strap level (Nvidia cards 10x0 series only). The possible values are 0 to 6. 0 is the default value and uses the default timings from the VBIOS. Each strap level corresponds to a predefined combination of memory timings (-vmt1, -vmt2, -vmt3, -vmr). Strap level 3 is the fastest predefined level and may not work on most cards, 1 is the slowest (but still faster than the default timings). Strap levels 4 to 6 are the same as 1 to 3 but with less aggressive refresh rates (i.e. lower -vmr values).  -straps &lt;n&gt;Memory strap level (AMD Vega cards only). The possible values are 0 to 5. 0 is the default value and uses the default timings from the VBIOS. Each strap level corresponds to a predefined combination of memory timings. Strap level 5 is the fastest level and may not work on most cards, 1 is the slowest (but still faster than the default timings). Note that straps for AMD cards are experimental and may lead to crashes or instability. -vmt1, -vmt2, and -vmt3 parameters have no effect on AMD cards  -vmt1 &lt;n&gt;Memory timing parameter 1 (0 to 100, default 0)  -vmt2 &lt;n&gt;Memory timing parameter 2 (0 to 100, default 0)  -vmt3 &lt;n&gt;Memory timing parameter 3 (0 to 100, default 0)  -vmr &lt;n&gt;Memory refresh rate (0 to 100, default 0). For AMD cards you may also use -rxboost  -nvmem &lt;n&gt;Force using straps on unsupported Nvidia GPUs (0 - do not force, 1 - GDDR5, 2 - GDDR5X). Make sure that the parameter matches your GPU memory type. You can try this if your card is Pascal-based but when you try to use -straps or any other memory timing option, the card is shown as “unsupported”.  -rxboost &lt;n&gt;Memory refresh rate on AMD cards (0 - default value, 1 - predefined value that should work on most cards, 2 to 100 - increasingly aggressive settings). If you want to fine tune the value, you may run the miner with -rxboost 1, write down the corresponding -vmr values that are showed in the log file, and then use -vmr instead with adjusted values.  -vmdag &lt;n&gt;Reset straps to default during DAG generation (default: 1)  -mcdag &lt;n&gt;Reset GPU memory clock to default during DAG generation. Nvidia only, default: 0 (turned off). This may allow you to set higher memory overclock on your Nvidia cards without risking corrupt DAG buffer, which can lead to excessive number of stale shares. Under Linux this option will execute the daggen.sh script (if present in the current directory) for each GPU, passing the GPU index as the first argument, and PCIE bus ID as second argument. The miner will then wait for about 7 seconds before starting DAG generation to allow the script enough time to reset the memory overclock.    General Options    -listList the detected GPUs devices and exit  -v,–versionShow the version and exit  -vsShow short version string (e.g. 4.1c) and exit  -h,–helpShow information about the command-line options and exit    Per-GPU options   Some of the PhoenixMiner options can provide either the same setting for all GPUs, or a different setting for each of the GPUs.   For example, to specify the -gt value for all cards you would write -gt 90 but if you want to specify a different GT value for each of the cards, use something like this: -gt 20,15,40,90,90 for a five-GPU mining rig. This would set GT to 20 for the first GPU, 15 for the second GPU, and so on.   If you specify less values than you have GPUs, the rest of the GPUs will use the default value for the parameter.   You can also use another, more flexible way of specifying different values for the different cards. This is best explained by example: -cclock *:1100,1-3:1090,4:1300 - here we are setting core clock to 1100 MHz for all cards, except the cards 1 to 3, on which it is set to 1090 MHz, and card 4 to 1300 MHz. The part before the colon (:) is the selector, which selects the GPUs for which the value after the colon is applied. The selector can be:   single GPU index: e.g. 5:1000 sets 1000 for the 5th GPU range of GPU indexes: e.g 2-5:1200 sets 1200 for the GPUs 2,3,4, and 5 asterisk, which sets the value for all GPUs label amd or nvidia: e.g. amd:1090 sets the value to 1090 for all AMD cards arbitrary string that starts with letter and can contain letters, numbers and asterisks, which is matched with the GPU name as listed by PhoenixMiner. Example: gtx*1070:+500 will set value +500 for all cards which contain ‘gtx’ and ‘1070’ in their names with anything between them. This will match ‘Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070’ but not ‘Nvidia GeForce 1070’.  Note that if more than one selector matches given card, than only the last one counts. Example: -cclock *:1100,1-4:1090,2:1300 will set card 2 to 1300; cards 1,3, and 4 to 1090; and the rest of the cards to 1100 MHz core clock.  ","categories": ["documentation"],

Inside the archive you will find a file README.txt with installation instructions.   Make sure to replace the pool and wallet address by what you’re using in all files.   Changelog   The new features in this release (since 5.6c) are:      Lower percent of rejected/stale shares when mining on Nicehash   Fixed problem with reading GPU temperature with some AMD GPUs/drivers   Latest AMD Windows drivers 21.5.1 are already supported since 5.6c   Other small fixes and improvements   The changes of the previous beta (5.6c) since the last version (5.5c) are:      Added native kernels for AMD RX6700 GPUs. These are faster than the generic kernels and produce a lot less stale shares   Increase the max supported DAG epoch to 550 (should be enough to about Jan 2023)   Full support for setting clocks, fan speeds, voltages, and memory timings of AMD RX6900/6800/6700 cards   The specific hashrate is now shown in the form of kilo hashes per joule (kH/J). Example: if a GPU has hashrate of 30 MH/s with 100W power usage, the specific hashrate is 300 kH/J   Added new command-line parameters -ttj and -ttmem, allowing automatic fan speed control based on GPU hotspot (junction), and memory temperatures respectively. Example: -ttmem 83 will keep the GPU memory temperature at or bellow 83C by increasing the fan speed as necessary. These parameters can be combined with -tt, as well as with each other. These options are supported only on AMD GPUs that report junction and memory temperatures   Added new command-line parameters -tmaxj and -tmaxmem, allowing to decrease the GPU usage when the GPU hotspot (junction), or GPU memory temperatures are above the specified thresholds. These options are supported only on AMD GPUs that report junction and memory temperatures   Added support for AMD Windows drivers 21.3.2, and 21.3.1   Added support for AMD Linux drivers 20.50.x. Use this drivers only if you have Polaris or older GPUs, or the latest RX6x000 GPUs. WARNING: Vega, Radeon VII, and Navi GPUs won’t work with these drivers!   Turn off the zero fan feature on AMD cards whenever a fixed fan speed is used (e.g. -tt -40), or when an auto fan with min fan speed is used (e.g. -tt 63 -minfan 35). To disable this feature, add -fanstop 1 command-line parameter   When -mcdag 1 is specified under Linux, the miner will not wait for the daggen.sh script to finish before starting to generate the DAGs. Instead it will for a fixed 7 seconds. This allows you to do all the following in the daggen.sh: turn off the overclocking of Nvidia GPUs, sleep for 30-60 seconds to allow time for DAG generation, and then re-apply the overclocking of the Nvidia GPUs   Other small improvements and fixes   The support for -ttj, -ttmem, -tmaxj, and -tmaxmem for Nvidia 3090 and 3080 GPUs is not yet ready for release. We hope to have it ready for the final 5.6 release.

        "excerpt":"Instead of using command-line options, you can also control PhoenixMiner with configuration files.    You can download PhoenixMiner 5.7b from here:   Download Now   Download (mirror)   Instead of using command-line options (bat file), you can also control PhoenixMiner with configuration files. If you run PhoenixMiner.exe without any options, it will search for the file config.txt in the current directory and will read its command-line options from it.   If you want, you can use file with another name by specifying its name as the only command-line option when running PhoenixMiner.exe.   Note that PhoenixMiner supports the same configuration files as Claymore’s dual Ethereum miner so you can use your existing configuration files without any changes.   You will find an example config.txt file in the PhoenixMiner’s directory.   Simple configuration examples   # # PhoenixMiner configuration file # # If there are no command-line parameters when PhoenixMiner is started, it will search # for config.txt file in the current directory and will read all command-line options from it # # You can put one or more command-line parameters on each line (separate them with spaces) # If the line starts with '#' it will be ignored as comment # # NOTE. PhoenixMiner also \"understands\" the config.txt files of Claymore's dual Ethereum miner # (but some of its options are not supported and will be ignored) #  #-pool eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -pool2 us1.ethermine.org:4444 #-wal YourEthWalletAddress.WorkerName #-proto 3 #-cdm 2  # Uncomment this to force the miner to read the dual-mining pools from the dpools.txt file # instead of the command-line #-dcoin blake2s    Instead of specifying the pool(s) directly on the command line, you can use another configuration file for this, named epools.txt. There you can specify one pool per line (you will find an example epools.txt file in the PhoenixMiner’s directory).   For the dual mining pools, you can use the dpools.txt file, which has the same format as epools.txt but for the secondary coin. You will find an example dpools.txt file in the PhoenixMiner’s directory.   Note that unlike the epools.txt, which is loaded each time when the miner starts, the dpools.txt file is only read if you specify a dual mining pool on the command line with -dpool, or if you add the -dcoin blake2s command-line option.   You can combine the config.txt file with some options that are specified directly on the command-line by using the -config &lt;name&gt; command-line option. It will instruct the miner to load a file with configuration options that will be added to the options read from the command-line.   The advantages of using config.txt and epools.txt/dpools.txt files are:      If you have multiple rigs, you can copy and paste all settings with these files   If you control your rigs via remote control, you can change pools and even the miner options by uploading new epools.txt files to the miner, or by uploading new config.txt file and restarting the miner.

This avoids any additional loses and instabilities becuase of additional DAG generation, and also allows you to use older cards with small VRAM or low hashate on current DAG epochs (e.g. GTX970, 280X).   Supports the Ubqhash algorithm for the UBQ coin. Please note that you must add -coin ubq to your command line (or COIN: ubq to your epools.txt file) in order to mine UBQ   Supports the ProgPOW algorithm for the Bitcoin Interest (BCI) coin mining. Please note that you must add -coin bci to your command line (or COIN: bci to your epools.txt file) in order to mine BCI   Full compatibility with the industry standard Claymore’s Dual Ethereum miner, including most of command-line options, configuration files, and remote monitoring and management.   More features coming soon!   Requirements   PhoenixMiner requires Windows x64 (Windows 7, Windows 10, etc.), or Linux x64 (tested on Ubuntu LTS and Debian stable).   PhoenixMiner also supports dual mining (simultaneous mining of ethash/ubqhash and other cryptocoin algorithm).   Currently we support only Blake2s as secondary algorithm for dual mining.   Note that when using dual mining, there is no devfee on the secondary coin but the devfee on the main coin is increased to 0.9%. In other words, if you are using the dual mining feature PhoenixMiner will mine for us for 35 seconds every 65 minutes.   Fee  The fee for using the program is 0.65%.   While the miner is running, you can use some interactive commands. Press the key h while the miner’s console window has the keyboard focus to see the list of the available commands. The interactive commands are also listed at the end of the following section.  ","categories": ["documentation"],

Changelog   The new features in this release (since 5.6d) are:   The problem with the missing GPU temperatures on Nvidia GPUs is fixed and we released new version with the fix: PhoenixMiner 5.6d. You can find the download links and checksums in this post.   If you are already running 5.6c and your rigs are not showing GPU temperatures, the easiest fix is to add the command-line option -hstats 2   Of course, you can also upgrade to PhoenixMiner 5.6d but the only difference between 5.6c and 5.6d is the fixed problem with GPU temperatures not shown with some Nvidia cards.   Sorry about this regression, we happen to run all of our test rigs with -hstats 2 and that’s why we didn’t detect the problem sooner.

Changelog      Implemented new “turbo” kernels (-clkernel 3) for AMD Polaris cards that can work with the current DAG sizes over 4 GB. Note that -clkernel 3 uses double the VRAM and will provide slightly faster hashrate with slightly higher power consumption. You can use the -rvram command-line parameter to specify how much VRAM to be left unused   Increased the maximum supported DAG epoch to 600 (i.e. until about Sep 2023)   Implemented full hardware control for AMD RX6900/6800/6700 cards under Linux. Note that with these cards under Linux you need to specify relative core voltage: e.g. -cclock -50 will set the core voltage to be 50 mV under the default value   Added ROCr kernels for Vega, Radeon VII and Navi cards. With these kernels you will be able to run these cards with Linux drivers 20.45 and later but the performance will be lower than with the older PAL drivers and kernels. We recommend using AMD Linux driver 20.30 for all cards except RX6900/6800/6700   Fixed an issue causing crashing with some RX6900/6800/6700 cards under Linux (there is no need to run these cards with -clkernel 0 anymore)   Added support for AMD Windows drivers up to 21.7.2. Note that Radeon VII cards will not work with drivers 21.6.1 or higher - you need to use older drivers for proper operation of these cards   Added support for AMD Linux drivers up to 21.20 (use older drivers for Vega or Radeon VII cards as they will not work with 21.20)   Numerous other fixes and small improvements   For more robust integrity check, you can use our GPG public key, which was verifyed with ETH transaction from our main devfee account as explained here.
