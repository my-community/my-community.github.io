        "excerpt":"we are actively working on bringing many new features in the future releases.    Introduction   Make sure to replace the pool and wallet address by what you’re using in all files.   PhoenixMiner is fast (arguably the fastest) Ethash (ETH, ETC, etc.) miner that supports both AMD and Nvidia cards (including in mixed mining rigs).   It runs under Windows x64 and Linux x64 and has a developer fee of 0.65% (the lowest in the industry). This means that every 90 minutes the miner will mine for us, its developers, for 35 seconds.   PhoenixMiner also supports Ubqhash for mining UBQ, ProgPOW for mining BCI, and dual mining Ethash/Ubqhash with Blake2s.   The hashrate is generally higher than Claymore’s Ethereum miner (we have measured about 0.4-1.3% hashrate improvement but your results may be slightly lower or higher depending on the GPUs, drivers, and other variables).   To achieve highest possible hashrate on AMD cards you may need to manually adjust the GPU tune factor (a number from 8 to about 400, which can be changed interactively with the + and - keys while the miner is running).   If you have used Claymore’s Dual Ethereum miner, you can switch to PhoenixMiner with minimal hassle as we support most of Claymore’s command-line options and configuration files.   Please note that PhoenixMiner is extensively tested on many mining rigs but there still may be some bugs.   Additionally, we are actively working on bringing many new features in the future releases. If you encounter any problems or have feature requests, please post them in our thread on the bitcointalk.org forum.   ","categories": ["documentation"],

        "excerpt":"we are actively working on bringing many new features in the future releases.    FAQ      Q001: Why another miner?   A: We feel that the competition is good for the end user. In the first releases of PhoenixMiner we focused on the basic features and on the mining speed but we are now working on making our miner easier to use and even faster.   Q002: Can I run several instances of PhoenixMiner on the same rig?   A: Yes, but make sure that each GPU is used by a single miner (use the -gpus, -amd, or -nvidia command-line options to limit the GPUs that given instance of PhoenixMiner actually uses).   Another possible problem is that all instances will use the default CDM remote port 3333, which will prevent proper remote control for all but the first instance. To fix this problem, use the -cdmport command-line option to change the CDM remote port form its default value.      Q003: Can I run PhoenixMiner simultaneously on the same rig with other miners?   A: Yes, but see the answer to the previous question for how to avoid problems.   Q004: What is a stale share?   A: The ethash coins usually have very small average block time (15 seconds in most instances). On the other hand, to achieve high mining speed we must keep the GPUs busy so we can’t switch the current job too often. If our rigs finds a share just after the someone else has found a solution for the current block, our share is a stale share. Ideally, the stale shares should be minimal as same pools do not give any reward for stale shares, and even these that do reward stall shares, give only partial reward for these shares. If the share is submitted too long after the block has ended, the pool may even fully reject it.   Q005: Why is the percentage of stale shares reported by PhoenixMiner smaller than the one shown by the pool?   A: PhonixMiner can only detect the stale shares that were discovered after it has received a new job (i.e. the “very stale”) shares. There is additional latency in the pool itself, and in the network connection, which makes a share stall even if it was technically found before the end of the block from the miner’s point of view. As pools only reports the shares as accepted or rejected, there is no way for the miner to determine the stale shares from the pool’s point of view.   Q006: What is the meaning of the “actual share difficulty” shown by PhoenixMiner when a share is found?   A: It allows you to see how close you were to finding an actual block (a rare event these days for the most miners with reasonable-sized mining rigs). You can find the current difficulty for given coin on sites like whattomine.com and then check to see if you have exceeded it with your maximum share difficulty. If you did, you have found a block (which is what the mining is all about).   Q007: What is the meaning of “effective speed” shown by PhoenixMiner’s statistics?   A: This is a measure of the actually found shares, which determines how the pool sees your miner hashrate. This number should be close to the average hashrate of your rig (usually a 2-4% lower than it) depending you your current luck in finding shares. This statistic is meaningless in the first few hours after the miner is started and will level off to the real value with time.   Q008: Why is the effective hashrate shown by the pool lower than the one shown by PhoenixMiner?   A: There are two reasons for this: stale shares and luck. The stale shares are rewarded at only about 50-70% by most pools. The luck factor should level itself off over time but it may take a few days before it does. If your effective hashrate reported by the pool is consistently lower than the hashrate of your rig by more than 5-7% than you should look at the number of stale shares and the average share acceptance time - if it is higher than 100 ms, try to find a pool that is near to you geographically to lower the network latency. You can also restart your rig, or try another pool.   ","categories": ["documentation"],

The last one controls the memory refresh rate, and the first three are other timings. The possible values for each of them are from 0 to 100, where 0 are the default timings, and 100 is the most aggressive timing (most GPUs probably wont work with 100). \tThe -straps option gives an easy way to set one of the predefined levels of VRAM timing adjustment. The possible values are 0 to 6. 0 is the default value and uses the default timings from the VBIOS. Each strap level corresponds to a predefined set of memory timings (\"-vmt1\", \"-vmt2\", \"-vmt3\", \"-vmr\"). Strap level 3 is the fastest predefined level and may not work on most cards, 1 is the slowest (but still faster than the default timings). Strap levels 4 to 6 are the same as 1 to 3 but with less aggressive refresh rates (i.e. lower \"-vmr\" values). \tWhen using the VRAM timing options, start with lower values and make sure that the cards are stable before trying higher and more aggressive settings. You can use -straps along with the other options. For example -straps 1 -vmt1 60 will use the timings from 1st strap level but -vmt1 will be set to 60 instead of whatever value is specified by the 1st strap level. In such case the -straps option must be specified first. \tThe VRAM timing options can be quite different between the GPUs, even when the GPUs are the same model. Therefore, you can (and probably should) specify the VRAM timing options separately for each GPU. Please let us know if you have any problems or questions related to PhoenixMiner 5.1b.

Changelog   The changes in this release (since 5.2c) include the following:      Added support for -daglim for AMD Fiji, Tonga, and Baffin cards with 4GB VRAM, so you will be able to use them some time beyond epoch 373 (Windows), or 381 (Linux)   New kernels for 4GB AMD cards with higher hashrate when -daglim is in effect   Added -daglim and -rxboost support in Linux. The default -daglim value in Linux is 4064 for older drivers (before 19.50), and 4076 for the newer drivers   Added support for the AMD Linux drivers 20.20, and 20.30   Added support for the latest AMD Linux drivers 20.40-1147286 (however they seem to have hardware control problems with some cards, so no need to upgrade for now)   The changes of the previous beta (5.2c) since the last version (5.1c) are:      The kernels are modified to allow bigger DAG limit of 4023 MB under Windows.

Use the -straps command-line option to activate it (example: -straps 1 will activate the lowest strap level)   The Nvidia memory timing (straps) option is improved and now is turned off during DAG generation to avoid any possible instability issues   Many other small improvements and fixes   Additional notes   Here are some additional notes:      The -daglim option works on Polaris (RX470, RX480, RX570, RX580, RX590), Baffin (RX560, RX550), Tonga, and Fiji cards. It limits the DAG size to &lt;n&gt; MB to allow mining on 4 GB cards a few weeks after epoch 374 on Windows (or after 381 on Linux). The possible values are the exact DAG limit in MB, or 0 (turn off the DAG limit), or 1 (automatic DAG limit size, usually around 4023 MB under Windows; this is the default option). Note that the hashrate will drop significantly with each epoch after the DAG limit is in effect. If the hashrate drops too much (e.g. from 28 MH/s to just 2-3 MH/s, you need to use lower value, for example -daglim 3990   (Windows) With PhoenixMiner 5.2d either remove the -daglim option entirely (it is set to auto by default), or set it to -daglim 4023, which should work on all 470/480/570/580/590 cards with “good” drivers (see bellow)   (Windows) If you cards doesn’t work with the default DAG limit of 4023 and require substantial decrease to 4006 or 3990, you need to update to one of the “good” AMD drivers for Windows: from 18.12.1.1 to 19.7.5 (inclusive), and from 19.12.2 to 20.11.1 (inclusive)   (Linux) With PhoenixMiner 5.2d either remove the -daglim option entirely (it is set to auto by default), or set it to -daglim 4064 on older drivers (before 19.50), or -daglim 4076 on newer drivers.   (Linux) When the -daglim option is in effect (i.e. if you are mining ETH or ETC with 4GB cards), the miner will restart on each new DAG epoch, and will force serial (one-by-one) generation of the DAG buffers. To allow more stable operation under these conditions, it is best to use -rmode 0 and to use a script to restart the miner when it exits. Two such scripts are provided with the miner: start_amd_4g_old_drv.sh for older drivers (before 19.50, note that when using -rmode 0, the -daglim for these older drivers can be increased to 4068), and start_amd_4g_new_drv.sh for newer drivers. Make sure to change the pools and the wallet in these scripts with your own before using them for mining.   It is also important to use auto-tune (do not specify -gt values in the command line) because the optimal -gt value may change with each new epoch, and will definitely be different than before.   Using -rxboost, -vmr, or -straps on AMD cards requires running as administrator (or as root under Linux), so you need to run PhoenixMiner as administrator for the VRAM timing options to work. Note that the -mt option will still work without running as administrator.   The -rxboost option is only supported on GDDR5 cards (RX4xx/RX5xx or older).   The VRAM timing options can be quite different between the GPUs, even when the GPUs are the same model.

Those still use the current kernels and there are no speed increases from the previous PhoenixMiner release   Add support for the older AMD Linux driver 19.50-1011208-ubuntu-18.04 (used by some Linux mining OSes and other software)   Added new kernels to allow mining on AMD Hawaii cards (R9 390, etc.) with the current and future DAG epochs (even with DAG buffer above 4GB for the 8GB cards).   Note that the AMD Windows drivers do not support compute mode for Hawaii cards, so the hashrate will be quite low (14-15 MH/s with the current ETH DAG epoch). This problem is fixed under Linux, where you can get the full 29-30 MH/s speed out of the Hawaii cards.

Inside the archive you will find a file README.txt with installation instructions.   Make sure to replace the pool and wallet address by what you’re using in all files.   Changelog   The changes in this release (since 5.5b) include the following:      Added support for the latest AMD Windows driver 21.1.1 (still, we don’t recommend using the 21.1.1 driver yet - we had some instability issues with it even when just idling on the desktop!)   Added new -mcdag parameter to reset the memory overclock on Nvidia cards during DAG generation. This may allow you to set higher memory overclock on your Nvidia cards without risking corrupt DAG buffer, which can lead to excessive number of incorrect shares. Use -mcdag 1 (by default the value is 0, which means turned off) to use this new feature.   Under Linux -mcdag 1 will execute a shell script named daggen.sh (if present in the current directory) for each Nvidia GPU, passing the GPU index as the first argument, and PCIE bus ID as second argument. The miner will then wait for about 7 seconds before starting DAG generation to allow the script enough time to reset the memory overclock.   The -tt parameter is now strictly for controlling the fan behavior. E.g. -tt 60 sets auto-fan speed with target temperature 60C; -tt -70 sets fixed fan speed 70%; and -tt 0 turns off the fan control. All these can be specified per GPU.   There is a new -hwm parameter that allows controlling the frequency of the hardware monitoring, which was also done by -tt in the previous versions of PhoenixMiner   Other small improvements and fixes   The changes of the previous beta (5.5b) since the last version (5.4c) are:   Added native kernels for AMD RX6800 and RX6900 GPUs. These are faster than the generic kernels and produce a lot less stale shares Updated kernels for AMD Polaris, Vega and Navi GPUs that are slightly faster and use less power than before when mining ETH. To use these updated kernels, you need to use drivers 20.5.1 or later under Win10, or 20.10.x or later under Linux The Nvidia mining cards (P106, P104, etc.) can now use straps and hardware control options (power limit, memory overclock, max temperature, etc.) under Windows Added support for AMD Linux drivers 20.45-1164792 and 20.45-1188099.
